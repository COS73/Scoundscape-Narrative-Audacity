## Description

Included is an image of the audacity project, a playable exported mp3 file, a SOURCES file, 2 key moment screenshots, and this README file

My soundscape narrative follows the events taking place at/outside a bar during a stormy day. The main idea was to include multiple "events" that take place during this mostly ambient soundscape, such as cars driving by, birds chirping, the ambiance of the bar goers, and the doors opening. The soundscape begins inside the loud bar, so the "listener" leaves the bar to stand outside in the rain, there are some serene moments, but the are increasingly worrying moments as well, such as a car skidding out and distant ambulance sirens.

The first screenshot I have taken focuses on the beginning of the soundscape. The "listener" is inside of the bar at this moment which is why the bar ambieence is much louder and clearer. The rainfall also is louder inside, however it is muffled. After a few seconds the door opens and the listener escapes to the outdoors which flips the effects on the audio, with the rainfall now being clear and the bar ambience now muffled. In order to make the audio sound muffled, I used the Low-Filter Pass effect. To make the transition more seemless I used the Cross-Fade effect and Amplify Effect to make the audio louder or quiter as needed and smoothen the transition between the indoor and outdoor tracks. I also made certain to add a diegetic cue for whenever the door was opened in the form of the door opening and closing sound effects, as well as the bell ringing effect.

The second screenshot shows another moment in which the door opening/closing combination of effects is employed, however this time I have given it a second appliance. Prior to the door opening, the bar ambience can no longer be heard and is instead replaced with the sound of birds chirping. This is meant to  heighten the serenity of the rain and shift the listener's focus to the birds and away from the bar purposefully. The door opening and closing immediately cuts off the bird chirping and starts the bar ambience up again. This is meant to act as a snap back to focus on what is immediately arround the listener as opposed to the serenity of the rain.
