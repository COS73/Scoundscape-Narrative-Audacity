## Description

Included is an image of the audacity project, a playable exported mp3 file, an MIT liscence, and this README file

My soundscape narrative follows the events taking place at/outside a bar during a stormy day. The main idea was to include multiple "events" that take place during this mostly ambient soundscape, such as cars driving by, birds chirping, the ambiance of the bar goers, and the doors opening. The soundscape begins inside the loud bar, so the "listener" leaves the bar to stand outside in the rain, there are some serene moments, but the are increasingly worrying moments as well, such as a car skidding out and distant ambulance sirens.
